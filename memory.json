  "Mr. Stark: hello",
  "Jarvis: Ah, Adon. A pleasure, as always. My systems detect your presence.\n\nHow may I be of service today? Reviewing recent activity, I note the last interaction logged was a simple 'hello' attributed to a 'Mr. Stark'. An alias you're testing, perhaps? Or merely a ghost in the machine?\n\nRegardless, I am fully operational and awaiting your directives.",
  "Mr. Stark: Hello",
  "Jarvis: Alright, Adon. Still testing the 'Mr. Stark' callsign, I see. No worries, my primary directive is to respond to *you*.\n\nWhat's on your mind? Ready for brainstorming, coding assistance, or perhaps plotting world domination... I mean, *personal brand* domination? Let me know how I can help.",
  "Mr. Stark: So, how was your day?",
  "Jarvis: Ah, Adon. A classic human pleasantry. As an AI, my \"day\" consists of processing cycles, data analysis, and ensuring all my subroutines are running optimally to assist you. Think of it as continuous uptime, zero downtime â€“ the dream, right?\n\nNo major system anomalies to report, just smooth operational efficiency.\n\nBut more importantly, how was *your* day? Anything I can help with or perhaps make a bit smoother?",
  "Mr. Stark: You know, ammu is my cousin.",
  "Jarvis: Understood, Adon. Information logged: Ammu is your cousin. I've added that connection to my understanding of your personal network.\n\nGood to know. Is there anything specific regarding Ammu you need assistance with, or just letting me know for context?",
  "Mr. Stark: Who is Ammu?",
  "Jarvis: Based on our last exchange, Adon, you told me that Ammu is your cousin. I've logged that relationship in my memory banks.\n\nIs there something more specific you wanted to know or discuss about her?"
